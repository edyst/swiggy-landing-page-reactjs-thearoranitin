Hey, guess what? you don't have to actually run my project i have hosted my project on GitHub =====> https://darshanchhabra.github.io/swiggy-landing-page/
this repository does not have the dependencies since even though npm build was implemented, the folders were referenced in the .gitIgnore so they won't be pushed.
Although i did try to push them all anyway but the platform refused to push so many modules(which is the reason why they added it in gitIgnore in the first place) 
but potato-tomatoe i've found another way to actually display the output perfectly and efficiently. This repository right here should be used for code reference. Thank you for reading so much! Good Day!
